TODO:

Check using the correct data structures etc

Look at optimising most run 10% (probably in findhaiku)

Stop using exit(1) to terminate on critical errors, have proper fallback
Check am using __init__ properly instead of __new__, also should probably save with a destructor, or something like that
 - rssparser, gettextwithvi, arxivhaikulogger and twitter are fine
 - findhaiku.py does this when untex doesnt exist
 - In customdictionary, should have a seperate load_file() command which can fail?
