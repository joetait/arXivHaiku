TODO:

what if multiple tex files sent? - Maybe just string them together!

Add check for previously parsed files, etc

Stop using exit(1) to terminate on critical errors, have proper fallback
Check am using __init__ properly instead of __new__, also should probably save with a destructor, or something like that

Check all the getopt stuff, really not dont properly atm 
  - Should be able to give options in any order etc, 
  - setting -t and -p should be illegal in customdictionary

Errors:
