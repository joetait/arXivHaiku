TODO:

Add mini off-switch for fb and twitter, for testing etc

logging isn't done yet

findhaiku has some ugly stuff in it, particularly nsyl etc - no need for this "-" stuff, just replace with " ".  Is the if statement ever called either? 

Add "-" to allowed stuff in custom dictionary and stop using it in nsyl
