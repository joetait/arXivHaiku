Dictionary Overhaul: Use an XML schema
Make sure to call save_dict
Use of custom_dictionary not ideal in findhaiku!

what if multiple tex files sent? - Maybe just string them together!
integrate properly with twitter
Check how it behaves with "-" used as a punctuation seperator..
Add check for previously parsed files, etc

Should I use -m in untex? Or add a switch?

Check how it deals with single characters

Stop using exit(1) to terminate on critical errors, have proper fallback
Check am using __init__ properly instead of __new__, also should probably save with a destructor, or something like that


Check all the getopt stuff

Errors:
Many abound - check the logs!

Dictionary error?
