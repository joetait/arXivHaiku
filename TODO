TODO:
Add ability to change debug level in all getopts

Make sure to call save_dict
Use of custom_dictionary not ideal in findhaiku!

what if multiple tex files sent? - Maybe just string them together!
integrate properly with twitter
Check how it behaves with "-" used as a punctuation seperator..
Add check for previously parsed files, etc

Should I use -m in untex? Or add a switch?

Check how it deals with single characters

Stop using exit(1) to terminate on critical errors, have proper fallback
Check am using __init__ properly instead of __new__, also should probably save with a destructor, or something like that

Check all the getopt stuff, really not dont properly atm 
  - Should be able to give options in any order etc, 
  - setting -t and -p should be illegal in customdictionary

Errors:
Many abound - check the logs!
Recursion errors abound, maybe check lengths of things before splitting again and again!

Dictionary error?
Found the following Haiku in 1209.3215:
 maximum at ,  and minimum at . s
